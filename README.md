exercises of the openSAP course Africa Code Week: Teaching Programming to Young Learners

In preparation for the [EU Code Week][eu-codeweek], openSAP has realeased a MOOC to [learn how to teach programming to young learners][opensap-africa], based on Scratch. This repo stores the exercises I have done during this course.

They are now [2 main versions of Scratch][scratch-versions]. The version 1.4 is shipped with Ubuntu or Raspbian, it has to be installed and the project files are binary. This is the version I have used (even if using binary files with Git is not great). The version 2.0 is web based, and the project files are based on JSON.

The exercises are great for a hand-on on Scratch. They can also be proposed to the children during the course.

## Exercise 1

The purpose of the first exercise is to create a project with several walking sprites. This is one for the first task that can be done with Scratch. It will learn the basic project organisation and the graphical capabilities of the platform, including the editor.

## Exercise 2

In this exercise, two sprites have a conversation. The main difference compared to the previous exercise is that the sprites will interact to each other. That will also learn how to handle events.

## Exercise 3

You can draw geometric figures with Scratch. The third exercise explains the basics to do so. This is a really exciting features, since you can draw mathematically interesting patterns, like [tessellation][wikipedia-tessellation] for example. You can also draw famous fractals, like the [Koch Snowflake][wikipedia-koch-snowflake], but many more. Let's call it a first step into computer art.

## Exercise 4

The fourth exercise a game development. In this game, a police car will chase a gangster car. As you have to create the backdrop and the cars by yourself, you will extensively use the editor and will became a true pyxel artist. The main lesson is probably how to plan the development of the game, as a software engineer would do it.

Enjoy Scratch and enjoy teaching code to children!
