openSAP exercise of the course Africa Code Week: Teaching Programming to Young Learners

In preparation for the [EU Code Week][eu-codeweek], openSAP has realeased a MOOC to [learn how to teach programming to young learners][opensap-africa]. This repo stores the exercises I have done during this course.

They are now [2 main versions of Scratch][scratch-versions]. The version 1.4 is shipped with Ubuntu or Raspbian, it has to be installed and the project files are binary. This is the version I have used (even if binary files is not great with Git). The version 2.0 is web based, and the project files are based on JSON.
